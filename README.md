# Synthead D7811G Breakout Board

This little PCB helps you socket your D7811G CPU!  These are found in a lot of Roland and Casio synthesizers.

If you have socketed your D7811G to use the [KiwiTechnics Kiwi-106 CPU upgrade](https://www.kiwitechnics.com/kiwi-106.htm), this PCB offers a way to use the original CPU with the existing socket.
